# MyReads Project

Simple cataloging app to place books in one of three shelves or categories and search for books based on title or author name.

Categories: 

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read


You can check the steps that I've taken to solve the task by checking the branches or the commits

- Converting the starter code to TS and making the project with the normal ReactJs props and states on the (using-props) branch
- Using Redux and applying actions and reducers on (using-redux) branch
- Applying the unit testing using Jest and enzyme Â on (apply-unitTesting) branchThe full project will be on the master branch

The app is the first of three projects required for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

Setup:
- "npm install"

Usage:
- run the project with "npm start"
- to run the Unit-Testing "npm test"
- The project can be viewed in the browser at "http://localhost:3000"
